## v0.1.1 - 2026-03-29

### Added

- unit selection: click a player unit on the board to select it (gold ring indicator)
- movable cell highlighting: BFS-based reachable cell calculation respecting move_range and occupied cells
- cyan highlight overlay on all valid move targets when a unit is selected
- click-to-move: click a highlighted cell to move the selected unit there
- MOVE crest cost: each move consumes 1 MOVE resource from the dice crest pool
- "Selected: ..." display in the debug panel showing current selection state
- debug panel auto-refreshes crest pool display after each move
- `BoardManager.get_reachable_cells()`: BFS within move_range, skipping occupied cells
- `UnitManager.board_manager` sync: spawn/move/despawn now keep `BoardManager.occupied_cells` in sync
- `UnitManager.unit_moved` signal for move event tracking
- `UnitManager.get_player_units()` helper
- `BattleFlowController.try_move_unit()`: validates reachability, pays MOVE crest, executes move
- `BattleFlowController.get_reachable_cells_for()`: delegates to BoardManager BFS
- `BattleFlowController.move_completed` signal
- `BoardView` signals: `unit_selected`, `unit_deselected`, `move_requested`
- `DiceDebugPanel.bind_board_view()` for selection event subscription
- `move_range` field now stored in unit state and passed from UnitData on spawn

### Changed

- `BoardView.mouse_filter` changed from `MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE` to `MOUSE_FILTER_STOP` to enable click input
- debug panel height increased from 380 to 440 to accommodate new selected unit label
- `Main._wire_debug_views()` now connects board view signals and binds board view to debug panel

### Notes

- only player units can be selected and moved
- only orthogonal movement (up/down/left/right) is supported
- no attack system implemented yet
- no pathfinding beyond BFS range check
- no movement animation; position updates are instant

## v0.1.2 - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- dice roll now limited to once per turn: `start_player_roll()` only executes during PLAYER_ROLL phase, then auto-transitions to PLAYER_ACTION
- Roll Dice button in debug panel is disabled after rolling (re-enabled only in PLAYER_ROLL phase)
- movable cell highlights now respect MOVE crest availability: `get_reachable_cells_for()` returns empty when MOVE <= 0
- highlights refresh immediately after every move attempt (success or failure), clearing when MOVE is exhausted

### Notes

- no "End Turn" button yet; to roll again after spending resources, a phase-reset mechanism is still needed
- the roll-once restriction is per phase transition, not a stored flag — future turn flow will manage this naturally

## v0.1.3 - 2026-03-29

### Added

- End Turn button in debug panel: ends player action phase and advances to next round
- `BattleFlowController.end_player_turn()`: clears crest pool, increments round_index, resets to PLAYER_ROLL
- `BattleFlowController.round_changed` signal emitted on round advance
- `DiceManager.reset_for_turn()`: clears crest pool and last roll results at turn boundary
- round number display ("Round: N") in debug panel
- End Turn button enabled only during PLAYER_ACTION, disabled otherwise
- BoardView deselects unit and clears highlights on any phase transition

### Changed

- debug panel height increased from 440 to 500 to accommodate End Turn button and round label
- debug panel layout reorganized: round label, phase label, selected label, Roll Dice, End Turn, Spawn Demo Path, roll results, crest pool
- `_on_phase_changed` now also refreshes crest pool display (shows zeroed pool after turn reset)

### Notes

- the minimum turn cycle now works: Roll Dice → move unit → End Turn → Roll Dice again
- crest pool is fully cleared at turn start (simple reset, no carry-over)
- no enemy turn yet; End Turn skips directly back to PLAYER_ROLL
- no attack system implemented

## v0.1.4 - 2026-03-29

### Added

- attack highlighting: red overlay on adjacent enemy cells when a player unit is selected and ATTACK crest > 0
- click-to-attack: clicking a red-highlighted enemy cell triggers a basic attack
- `BattleFlowController.try_attack_unit()`: validates adjacency, pays 1 ATTACK crest, applies damage via `AttackRuleHelper.calc_basic_damage()`
- `BattleFlowController.get_attackable_cells_for()`: delegates to `ActionResolver.get_attackable_cells()`, gated on ATTACK crest availability
- `BattleFlowController.attack_completed` signal (attacker_id, defender_id, damage, killed)
- `BoardView.attack_requested` signal for attack click events
- `BoardView.attack_highlight_cells` array for red attack target rendering
- `BoardView._draw_attack_highlights()`: red filled + red border rectangles on attackable cells
- `DiceDebugPanel._on_attack_completed()`: refreshes crest pool display after each attack
- `Main._on_attack_requested()`: wires attack signal, refreshes both move and attack highlights after attack
- if target HP <= 0, unit is despawned from board via existing `UnitManager.apply_damage()` → `despawn_unit()`

### Changed

- `_handle_cell_click()` now checks attack targets before move targets (attack takes priority on enemy-occupied cells)
- `_select_unit()` and `_on_state_changed()` now compute both move and attack highlights
- `_deselect()` now clears both highlight arrays
- `_on_move_requested()` now refreshes attack highlights alongside move highlights

### Notes

- minimum combat loop now works: Roll → Move → Attack → End Turn
- attack is melee-only (orthogonal adjacent, range 1)
- damage formula: max(1, attacker.atk - defender.def)
- no attack animation; damage is applied instantly
- no HP display on units yet
- no enemy turn or enemy AI
- no victory/defeat check on kill
